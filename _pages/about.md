I'm a forth-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/mathematics.html), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research interests include machine learning and optimization.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fang Kong](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/fangkong.html) from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en-us), SUSTech.
